This project is a simple interactive webpage that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking a button. It uses HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript to handle user interaction. When the user clicks the "Change color" button, a JavaScript function generates a random RGB color and applies it to the page's background with a smooth transition effect. The design is centered using Flexbox, with a dark theme by default and a styled button for better user experience.
